Shadow of the Necropolis 
Floating above the Plaguelands, the necropolis known as Naxxramas serves as the seat of one of the Lich King's most powerful officers, the dreaded lich Kel'Thuzad. Horrors of the past and new terrors yet to be unleashed are gathering inside the necropolis as the Lich King's servants prepare their assault. The Scourge marches again...

Naxxramas is the new 40-man raid dungeon that will present even the most experienced and powerful players with an epic challenge.

Shadow of the Necropolis transcript 
Kel'Thuzad says: I was cast out by my comrades, exiled. Forced to wander the Frozen Wastes. But I was not alone, not entirely. The voice, now my only companion guided me to my destination, strange, nightmarish creatures awaited me at the entrance, I felt my blood run cold, as cold as Icecrown itself. Inside I bore witness to horrific acts, demonstrations of power. Power that could be mine for the asking. Terrified I ran, but did not get far, all too soon my choice was made. Too late did I realize that such power does not come without a price. Aaaargh! Now the world will pay a far greater toll for I have returned. I am Kel'Thuzad your curiosity will be the death of you.

Official patch notes 
General 
The cost to unlearn talents will now decay over time. This cost will be reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold.
Logging back in after a disconnect from the server has been greatly improved, and players should now rarely receive the message "A character with that name already exists."
Temporary item buffs (e.g. poisons, sharpening stones and shaman weapon buffs) will persist through zoning or logging out.
Fear: The calculations to determine if Fear effects should break due to receiving damage have been changed. The old calculation used the base damage of the ability. The new calculation uses the final amount of damage dealt, after all modifiers. In addition, the chance for a damage over time spell to break Fear is now significantly lower. Note that Fear continues to be roughly three times as likely to break on player targets as on non-player targets. In addition, Intimidating Shout now follows that player versus non-player distinction, while previously it did not.
Periodic Healing: Spells which do periodic healing will now have their strength determined at the moment they are cast. Changing the amount of bonus healing you have during the duration of the periodic spell will have no impact on how much it heals for.
Reflection: Effects which cause reflection will no longer reflect triggered effects separately from their base effects (e.g. Impact, Improved Shadow Bolt, Aftermath, etc.)
Spell and Item Auras with Charges: These auras will now correctly remember their number of charges when you enter or leave an instance, change continents, or log out.
All controlled units will now be titled based on the creature type. All beasts will be referred to as Pets, for example (no matter how they are controlled). Previously, there were several inconsistencies.
Beneficial spells and abilities that target multiple units will no longer consume resources (i.e. mana, rage etc...) if they fail to affect anyone.
Chain targeted spells and abilities (e.g. Multi-shot, Cleave, Chain Lightning) will no longer land if target cannot be seen by the caster due to stealth or invisibility.
Character model transparency has been modified to fix an issue where PC's would appear to have a large hole in their model (be on the lookout!).
Optimization code known as "M2Faster" is now enabled by default. M2Faster can improve performance in crowded scenes when "Vertex Animation Shaders" is turned on. This function can be turned off by setting M2Faster to "0" in the config.wtg.
Reduces the unique number of vertex shader permutations that we will choose to use in rendering
Sorts the drawing of items in the scene a little differently to reduce the number of times we re-program the vertex shader hardware.
PVP 
In an effort to keep their armies better outfitted the Horde and Alliance have both taken it upon themselves to update their available rewards.
An updated set of armor rewards have been added to vendors for Honor ranks 7, 8, and 10.
The armor rewards for Honor ranks 12 and 13 have been increased in level and stat point allocation.
New rank 14 weapons have been added! In order to give casters the same diversity of selection that melee currently enjoy we have added new caster items that are available to be purchased by Grand Marshals and High Warlords.

Most of the NPC guard units have been removed.
Players now drop more quest items.
Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced.
The buff that is periodically cast by each faction's Captain has been changed to a flat 20% hit point buff.
Upgrading troops through armor scrap turn-ins will also now result in your team's General enabling a periodic buff to your melee and spell damage.
This buff scales from 10% at the Seasoned unit level, 20% at the Veteran unit level, and 30% at the Champion unit level.
Warsong Gulch - Epic leggings have been added to the Warsong Outrider and Silverwing Sentinel supply officers for all armor types. These items require Exalted status with their respective reputations.
Druids 
Innervate: This spell is now a base ability for all Druids, trainable at level 40. Any Druid who formerly had the Innervate talent now has the Swiftmend talent instead.
Nature's Grace: You will no longer consume this effect when casting a spell which was made instant by Nature's Swiftness.
Swiftmend: This new talent has been added to the Druid Restoration tree, replacing Innervate as the 31 point ultimate talent. It consumes a Rejuvenation or Regrowth aura to produce an instant heal.
Enrage: Tooltip ed to clarify functionality.
Hunters 
Counterattack (Survival Talent) - All ranks of this talent will now share the same cooldown.
Scorpid Poison: Duration slightly lengthened.
Changed the way hunter pet family armor bonuses and penalties are applied to allow the exact value from the Natural Armor talent to be applied correctly. This may result in a very slight loss of armor to some pets (less than a third of a percent).
Improved Scorpid Sting: The aura from this Sting will now be removed (as intended) when a different Sting aura is placed on the victim.

Paladins 
Benediction: This talent will no longer incorrectly provide a double discount to Seal of Justice.
Blessing of Light: It is no longer possible for a target to appear to have multiple ranks of Blessing of Light. These multiple auras had no beneficial effect, merely causing confusion. Problems with targeting the spell when the caster has Blessing of Light effect on them have also been fixed.

Illumination: When several critical effect healing spells are cast very quickly, you will now receive the correct mana refund for each one.

Improved Revenge ranks evened out, resulting in an additional 5% for the final rank. Chance to stun at each rank changed to 15/30/45%.
Bloodrage - Fixed a bug that caused Bloodrage to cost twice the intended health.
Flurry: The tooltip for this talent has been adjusted to indicate it only works on normal melee swings.
Shield Slam: This ability has received a redesign. It now costs 20 rage to use and the damage it does is modified by your shield block value. However, the base damage has been reduced. It generates more threat per rage and more damage per rage than it did previously.
Sweeping Strikes: This spell has a number of fixes: When used in conjunction with Execute and the second victim is below 20% health, they will be hit with the full Execute amount. If the second victim is not below 20% health, they will be hit with normal melee swing damage; If the ability you are using does not deal damage, it will not use a charge of Sweeping Strikes; The extra attack it generates when used with Whirlwind now has the correct damage range; The additional attacks generated by this ability will now properly take into account the armor of the second target.

We have re-evaluated the mechanics of consumable items in the game and concluded that these should work in a more intuitive manner. As such, most items that can not be equipped with right click abilities have been streamlined into one of three categories. Using an item of a particular category will trigger a shared cooldown among all other items in the same category. The categories break down as follows with category cooldowns as listed.
Potions 2 minutes: This includes items such as Health Potion, Mana Potion, Invisibility Potion and Mighty Rage Potion.
Aggressive 1 minute: This includes items such as explosives, Really Sticky Glue and Discombobulator Ray.
Non-Aggressive 2 minutes: This includes items such as Healthstone, Night Dragon's Breath, Whipper Root Tuber and Target Dummy.
Many items that can be equipped have had their cooldown category removed and will be controlled exclusively by the item's self cooldown. For example, the Gnomish Mind Control Cap should no longer trigger the cooldown of the Talisman of Arathor.
We have re-evaluated the class specific quest rewards for both Zul'Gurub and Ahn'Qiraj Ruins. To bring them more in line with the effort required to attain them we have upgraded the superior items to epic quality.

If you attempt to zone into the instance while that encounter is engaged, you will be resurrected at the outside entrance.

Players now have a Raid Info button on their raid interface that functions the same way /raidinfo worked before. This function will display a pane showing all of the raid instances that a player is saved to, rather than displaying it to the chat window.
Players in a party may now select an option that allows them to reset all currently open instances.
You only get the reset all instances option if you are a party leader.

Players can now turn on the "Target of Target" in the Raid and Party section of the interface options. When this is turned on, anytime a player is in a party or raid, it will show the portrait and health of whatever your current target has targeted. You can click on that portrait to target that thing directly or if you have the spell glove up you can cast spells on the target of target without targeting it directly.
Bags that you are carrying now have a brown background when opened and bags that are in your bank have a gray background when opened. This will allow a player to more easily tell the difference between a bag they are carrying and one that is in their bank.
When reputation increases from one level to the next (Friendly to Honored for instance) that text will be displayed to the chat log instead of to the combat log.
The Group Loot/Need before Greed dialogue will now show a golden dragon border around Bind on Pickup items.
The party leader can now reset a dungeon instance from the interface. If the party has recently been inside an instance but is now outside of the instance, the party leader will have a right-click option from their own portrait (where you select the loot UI preference) that is "Reset all Instances". If this is selected all non raid instances will be reset for the party.

UI Scripting 
Frame XML Change - There is a new "clampToScreen" attribute, which will prevent the frame from being dragged off the screen.
Button XML Changes
The button implementation has been changed from three fontstrings to a single fontstring with three font objects. This is more efficient, uses less memory, and reduces the complexity of defining a button. To support this, the existing NormalText, HighlightText, and DisabledText elements have been deprecated (though they will still work in 1.11 for backwards compatibility), and new elements ButtonText, NormalFont, HighlightFont, and DisabledFont are defined to replace them.
New API Functions
SetCursor() can now be passed a 32x32 texture filename, as well as a cursor mode, or nil to reset the cursor.
GetAddOnMetadata("addon", "field") - returns the value of the following fields in the addon TOC file: Title, Notes, Author, Version, and any field starting with X-
Region Script Object - Region is the base object type for all frames, textures and fontstrings. Region is also the type of object returned by the new Frame:GetTitleRegion() method. Region:GetObjectType() returns "Region", and Region:IsObjectType("type") returns true if "type" is "Region".
