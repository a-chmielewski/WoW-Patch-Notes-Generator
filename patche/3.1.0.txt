Secrets of Ulduar
Since discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have journeyed to the titan city to learn more about its mysterious past. Further exploration has revealed that the magnificent complex is above all a prison, intended to permanently confine the Old God of death, Yogg-Saron. This ancient horror has corrupted its guards, and now it is breaking through the last of its restraints. Faced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals has made preparations for a sweeping assault on the city. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and towering defenses at the city's entrance will take tremendous strength, but even that great victory may not be enough to overcome the madness that dwells below.

Rhonin says: How? How could we have missed this until now?
Jaina Proudmoore says: Ahem.
Rhonin says: Ah King Varian, thank you for coming on such short notice.
Varian says: What's this all about Rhonin?
says: I've, I've called you here to ask for your help, while our efforts against the Lich King press on, Brann here has brought us frightening news of the horrors beneath Ulduar and of it's dark prisoner.
Brann Bronzebeard says: Prisoner? Ha! With its bindings shattered, its influence unchecked, it's gonna come after us and we're gonna be the prisoners.
Rhonin says: You can see now what we're up against. If this evil is not stopped then the armies of the death god will march on our doorstep.
Jaina Proudmoore says: Oh no. You'll have to excuse me.
Varian Wrynn says: Well what do you propose we do?
Jaina Proudmoore says: Thrall what are you doing here so soon?
Thrall says: The summon sounded dire Jaina what's happened?
Jaina Proudmoore says: Brann Bronzebeard's forces assaulted the gates of Ulduar, they battled the Iron Lords and their cursed minions. He, he won't stop talking about this presence he felt, permeating the great halls, stirring in their minds, chilling their blood, he said the horror that the Titan's imprisoned so long ago, Yogg Saron, has awakened.
Garrosh says: I want to see this dwarf.
Thrall says: Garrosh!

Jaina Proudmoore says: Stop it!
Rhonin says: We have all lost a great deal in this conflict but we stand to lose everything if we do not stop fighting and work together.
Garrosh says: A true warchief would never partner with cowards.
Varian Wrynn says: At the Wrathgate the Horde's partnership killed more of our men than the Scourge. I'm done with your Horde may this death god take you all.
Thrall says: You disappoint me Garrosh.
Garrosh says: Ha.
{{Text|Say|Rhonin|The old god is laughing, toying with us.
{{Text|Say|Jaina Proudmoore|Who will be our hope?
Rhonin says: Who will stand and face Yogg Saron?

The Argent Tournament Begins!
As the might of the Scourge wanes under the pressure of Azeroth's heroes, the Argent Crusade have taken a foothold in Arthas's back yard. Off the northeastern coast of Icecrown, the Argent Crusade have sounded the call for the most bold and brave adventurers of the Horde and Alliance to take part in the Argent Tournament. Representatives of all ten faction capitals, from Undercity to Exodar, have traveled to the tournament grounds to find champions among their heroes who will prepare for the inevitable battle against the enemy of all living beings, the Lich King.
In Memoriam: Dave Arneson
Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate Secrets of Ulduar in memory of Dave Arneson. We were greatly saddened by the news of Dave's passing. His work, passion, and creativity helped give life to an entirely new genre of gaming, and our fondest memories of playing Dungeons & Dragons continue to inspire us. Farewell, Dave, and thank you. You will be missed.
