Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.
A dead player can now be resurrected by targeting them using the Party or Raid Frame even if they have released. No more hunting for corpses.
Portals to each of the capital cities have returned to Dalaran and Shattrath City.

The Focused Assault and Brutal Assault buffs have changed.
After 3 minutes of both teams having the flag, both flag carriers will get Focused Assault, which increases damage taken by 10%.
Every minute afterward, an additional stack will be applied to increase damage taken by an additional 10%.
After 7 minutes, Brutal Assault will be applied in place of Focused Assault. In additional to the damage debuff, this debuff also caps the player's movement speed at 100%. The damage taken debuff works the same and will add 10% to the debuff up to a maximum of 100% damage taken.

Arathi Basin is now available as a 10v10-player rated Battleground.
Flags should now cap in 7 seconds, down from 8.
The Battle for Gilneas
Flags should now cap in 7 seconds, down from 8.
Graveyard Changes
Players who die at a control point that they own will now be teleported to the next closest graveyard, instead of the one at which they died.
If a player's team owns the Mine and Waterworks, and dies at Waterworks, they will be teleported to the Mine.
If an Alliance player's team only owns Lighthouse, and dies at Lighthouse, they will respawn at their base.
If a Horde player's team owns Waterworks and Mine, and dies at Lighthouse, they will respawn at Waterworks.

Midfield players will respawn at the middle graveyard.

Warsong Gulch
The graveyards outside both bases have been lowered in elevation and are no longer on the same plane as the main flag room entrances to either respective base.
Quests & Creatures 
An updated quest chain has been added for the Alliance in Winterspring. Players seeking out the Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber should speak with Rivern Frostwind at Frostaber Rock.
A handful of quests have been added to Northern Barrens to provide more level 18-20 content. Look for new quests at Nozzlepot's Outpost and Darsok's Outpost.
Loot from the creatures Garr, Julak-Doom, Mobus, Akma'Hat, Xariona, and Poseidus has been adjusted to be commensurate to their rarity and invested effort.
Quest Bug Fixes

Race Bug Fixes

User Interface 
Like the Focus Frame, the character Unit and Target Frames can now be unlocked and moved to one's content.
Spells bound to a key now start to be cast when the button is pressed down by default, instead of waiting for the key to go up. This is an option that can be turned off in the Interface menu under Combat. Mouse clicking has not changed and operates on mouse click up.
Targets and focus targets now display on the mini-map.
Moved Video and Sound to a new "Options" screen.
Added a network category to the new Options screen and included the two network checkboxes.
The Network category contains the options "Optimize network for speed" and "Enable IPv6 when available". "Optimize network for speed" will be enabled by default, and will send packets more frequently at the cost of higher bandwidth. The higher bandwidth may lead to disconnects for some players who have limited bandwidth. Players getting disconnected frequently should try unchecking this box.
Visual Settings Updates
Removed the red bar preventing the overall graphics slider from going to ultra based on computer specs.
When a player moves the overall slider to a setting that would have previously been prevented, any option that can't go as high as that setting will get the warning icon with a tooltip explaining why it can't go higher. For example: a player sets the overall slider to Ultra and the water setting can only go to Fair. The water setting would automatically switch to Fair.
Support for DirectX 11 can now be found in the Advanced tab of the Options screen.
At the login screen:
Moved the "Reset User Options" button from the popup window that appears when clicking Options to the actual Options window.
Clicking Options now goes directly to the Video tab of the Options screen.
Removed the now-unneeded popup.
The New Features (!) Option screen has been updated:
Cast action keybinds on key down (Combat)
Pick Up Action Key (ActionBars)
Nameplate Motion Type (Names)
Graphics API (Advanced)
Network category
