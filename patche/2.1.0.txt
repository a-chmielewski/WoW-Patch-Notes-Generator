The Black Temple 
The Temple of Karabor was the center of draenei worship until its priests were slaughtered by demonically corrupted orcs. In the massacre's aftermath the warlocks of The Shadow Council seized the structure and gave it a new name: The Black Temple.

When The Alliance invaded Draenor after The Second War, the orc shaman Ner'zhul hastily opened several dimensional portals in order to escape. The resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. Drawn by these portals, the pit lord Magtheridon arrived in what had come to be known as Outland and took the temple as his seat of power.

His dominion over Outland remained unchallenged until the arrival of Illidan the Betrayer. The pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the Twin Blades of Azzinoth. Today Illidan occupies the temple, awaiting any and all who would challenge his rule.

The Black Temple transcript 

Akama says: I remember the temple as it used to be... a place of worship. I prayed within its chambers and mated among its gardens. I was happy then, at peace. I remember too the day the orcs came. The day marked by cries of war and a torrent of blood. The terrified women and children huddled in darkened corners. I led many to safety, but many more paid the ultimate price. That day my beloved sanctuary became the black temple. There, the orc warlocks practised their twisted magic that corrupted the land and nearly destroyed us all.
orc says: Do not do this Gul'Dan!
Gul'dan says: Bear witness to the undeniable power of our dark master!
orc says: He will destroy us all!
Akama says: Even after the Horde's reckless sorcery tore the planet apart. My people were unable to find a lasting sanctuary. I remember the armies of demons that swept down on us like a plague. During these dark times the one called Magtheridon made the temple his home. Then came Illidan, the one they call the betrayer, the enemy of my enemy.
Illidan says: Magtheridon lures scores of hapless demons through them daily.
Kael'thas Sunstrider says: Then we must seal them permanently.
Akama says: We helped him seal the portals of Outland and cut off the legion's reinforcements. We fought with renewed strength and together we reclaimed our sacred ground. I think part of me knew even then that the Black Temple had only traded one evil master for another. I prefer to remember the temple as it used to be not the abomination it has become. My soul bears the burden of my misjudgement. But I have been patient, I have been waiting and when the time is right the betrayer will become the betrayed.
