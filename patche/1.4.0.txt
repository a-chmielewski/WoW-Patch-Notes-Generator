PvP Honor System 
The Player versus Player Honor System is now active. Players will be able to gain rankings based on their PvP performance, with lucrative rewards for those who distinguish themselves on the field of battle! Read more about the PvP Honor system.

Children's Week 
Children's Week is celebrated in Orgrimmar and Stormwind City at the start of May and lasts for a week. It is a time to give back to the innocents of war: the orphans!

Gurubashi Arena event 
There is now a regular event in Gurubashi Arena in Stranglethorn Vale. Every three hours starting at midnight, a pirate with too much treasure on his hands will drop a chest in the center of the arena. Whoever can open the chest first gets the contents! Of course, the arena is a PvP Free for All area, so there might be other players who are trying to open it first...

Elemental invasions! 
Invasions by elementals at different locations on Kalimdor have reportedly been occurring sporadically every few days. Concerned adventurers should investigate Silithus, Un'Goro Crater, Azshara, and Winterspring to counter these incursions.

Details 
General 
Charm and Polymorph mechanics can now be reactively countered by spells and abilities (e.g. Druid Shapeshifting will now cancel Polymorph effects).
Mana regeneration is now disrupted when a spell has completed casting rather than at the start of casting. It will resume normally five seconds after the last spell cast. This change increases the total time spent regenerating mana and therefore increases the total contribution from Spirit for mana-based classes.
Level 60 mounts purchased at vendors now have a whole new look. Faster undead mounts already have a different look and so have not changed. The new mounts can be seen standing near the mount vendors. If you have one of the old fast mounts, you can exchange it for one with a new look at the mount vendor.
Healing-over-time spells should now be improved by "+Healing" items when cast on other players.
Mind Controlled characters will no longer receive a durability penalty when they die.
When a non-Hunter resurrects a pet, the pet will no longer receive resurrection sickness.
PvP 
A handful of spells were added to the list of spells subject to diminishing returns in PvP. It is our goal to set as few spells as possible to be diminished. We've identified this short list of spells as having durations and cooldowns sufficient to almost permanently slow or immobilize targets but without adequate controls or other limiting factors. When a spell with diminishing returns is used against a target in PvP, the first effect has full duration. On the second use of the same category of spell (e.g. slowing), that spell's duration is reduced by 50%. On the third use, the duration is reduced by 75%. On the fourth attempt, the target becomes immune to the spell. Spells must be used on the same target within 15 seconds of the *end* of the duration in order to be diminished. In other words, if a target hasn't had a slowing spell active on them for more than 15 seconds, the next slowing spell will have full effect. The list of affected spells is:
Frost Shock
Entangling Roots
Frost Nova
Guard directions, signs and signposts have been added to point you toward the PvP Officer Lounges in Stormwind City (Champions' Hall) and Orgrimmar (Hall of Legends).
Racial Traits 
Blood Fury - Now increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 seconds. When it fades base melee attack power is reduced by 25% for 45 seconds.
Perception - Increased detection bonus.
Berserking - Is now usable after being the target of a critical hit. Increases melee, ranged and spell casting speed by 25% but increases all damage taken by 10% for the duration.
Druids 
Ravage and Shred now properly increase the attack power contribution by the percent modifier.
Shapeshifting into an animal form will now remove Polymorph effects.
Feral Charge - Fixed a bug where the ability cost 10 rage instead of five as intended. Should now cost five rage.
Entangling Roots - Now subject to diminishing returns in PvP. This is considered an immobilizing effect.
Hunters 
A new Hunter epic quest series is now in the game and waiting to be found.
Scatter Shot (Talent) - Now usable while moving and no longer interrupts ranged combat. Now properly reduces the ranged attack power contribution by the percent modifier.
Highland Striders no longer have Cower (Rank 3) when tamed.
New Pet Ability: Dive - Increases movement speed for a short duration.
New Pet Ability: Dash - Increases movement speed for a short duration.
Freezing Trap - Visual changed.
Track Hidden - Increased stealth detection.
Scorpid Sting - Fixed a bug where it was not considered a poison. It can now be removed by poison curing effects.
Aspect of the Cheetah/Pack - These Aspects will now be canceled when mounted.
Viper Sting - This spell can no longer be used on warrior and rogue targets. In addition, while it can be used on a druid target at any time it will only drain mana when the druid is in caster form.
Mages 
Amplify Magic and Dampen Magic effects should now replace each other properly.
Improved Scorch (Talent) - Redesign. Scorch spells have a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to cause your target to be vulnerable to Fire damage. This vulnerability increases the Fire damage dealt to your target by 2% and can be stacked up to 5 times for a total of 10% increased Fire damage.
New Spell: Arcane Brilliance (available at level 56 - Loot) - Infuses the target's party with brilliance, increasing their Intellect.
Improved Mana Shield - Design changed. Instead of increasing the amount absorbed, it now decreases the mana lost per point of damage taken by 10/20%.
An error message is now displayed if you try to use Blink on boats and zeppelins.
Wand Specialization - Fixed a bug where the damage increase with this talent was higher than the listed amount.
Frost Nova - Now subject to diminishing returns in PvP. This is considered an immobilizing effect.
Pyroblast and Fireball damage over time will now stack together.
Paladins 
Seal of Wisdom and Seal of Light should now replace each other properly as well as stack properly when used by different paladins.
Paladin Epic Mount quest added. To begin, talk to the paladin trainers Duthroian Rall or Brandur Ironhammer.
Paladins who have completed their Epic Mount quest can repeat the final event in Scholomance for fun (and loot) by speaking with Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker.
Sanctity Aura - Fixed a bug where the spell/talent was unlearned after logging out if learned before level 40.
Resistance Auras - Paladins should now be able to switch from a resistance aura to any other resistance aura without canceling the current one first.
Improved Seal of Justice - Fixed a bug that caused the talent to have no effect. It will now increase the frequency that the stun effect will land.
Priests 
A new Priest epic quest series is now in the game and waiting to be found.
Levitate - Duration and mana cost increased.
Touch of Weakness - Should now be affected by the Blackout, Darkness, Force of Will, Shadow Focus, Shadow Weaving and Silent Resolve talents.
Starshards - Should now be affected by the Focused Casting, Force of Will, and Silent Resolve talents.
Holy Fire - Should now be affected by the Focused Casting talent.
Mind Flay - Should now be affected by the Focused Casting talent.
Desperate Prayer - Should now be affected by the Holy Specialization talents.
Vampiric Embrace - Active icon tooltip rewritten to be more clear.
Holy Nova - Now causes an explosion of holy light around the caster, causing Holy damage to all enemy targets within 10 yards and healing all party members within 10 yards. These effects now cause no threat as opposed to reducing threat temporarily.
Holy Fire - Several changes were made to Holy Fire in an effort to make this a more usable and efficient damage spell. The cast time was reduced from five seconds to four seconds, which reduces the damage caused. Therefore, the damage was increased and more of the spell's potency was shifted into the damage-over-time portion. The duration was also increased and mana cost and cooldown were both decreased. While the direct damage portion was reduced slightly from the previous version, each tick of damage should be unchanged, and the spell now delivers one additional tick of damage. In total, the relative damage and efficiency of the spell has been increased.
Wand Specialization - Fixed a bug where the damage increase with this talent was too high.
Rogues 
Combo points will no longer be removed if the target is deselected. They will only be removed if a different target is selected.
Fixed a bug where combo points were not always being applied to the target when using Cheap Shot, Ambush and Garrote.
Vanish - Increased stealth bonus.
Ambush, Backstab, Ghostly Strike, and Riposte now properly increase the attack power contribution by the percent modifier. Our goal is to make the dagger-based Backstab/Ambush build a viable alternative to the sword/mace-based Sinister Strike build. As a side effect, fixing this bug also increased maximum critical Ambush damage beyond our intentions. After considering a variety of balance changes (including reducing the percent modifier or base damage of Ambush, or reducing the Improved Ambush talents) we decided to change the Lethality talent to no longer affect Ambush. This does not counteract the DPS increase from the bug fix as Backstab is the primary source of DPS while Ambush is a source of high, one-time damage and cannot be used as consistent DPS. After all balance changes are considered, here are some details:
(Using a Barman Shanker with 2.0 weapon speed and between 500 and 800 attack power)
Ambush without the Lethality bonus and attack power bug fix (patch 1.4.0) causes between 4-12% more damage than --- â€¢ Ambush with the Lethality bonus and attack power bug (patch 1.3.1).
Backstab (patch 1.4.0) causes between 9-13% more damage than Backstab (1.3.1).
The Kick ability prevents the target from casting spells in the same school when channeled casting is interrupted.
If using Gouge triggers the Stormshroud Armor lightning effect, the Gouge effect will no longer be instantly interrupted.
The Rogue trainers will now point the player to an appropriate area with boxes to unlock depending on the lockpicking skill of the player.
Preparation - Will now clear the cooldown of the Blade Flurry ability.
Riposte - Fixed a bug that prevented the ability from being used when the target had no weapon or was already disarmed.
Shaman 
Earth Shock - The visual for ranks two through seven has been changed to be consistent with rank one.
Windfury - Fixed a bug that caused an additional attack beyond what was intended. In addition, fixed a bug that caused the next normal melee attack to happen sooner than intended.
Level 58+ Shaman should talk to Sagorne Creststrider in Orgrimmar; there is a special quest for them involving a dreaded death knight who dwells in the depths of the Scholomance.
Frost Shock - Now subject to diminishing returns in PvP. This is considered a slowing effect.
Grounding Totem - Should no longer redirect area effect spells or be destroyed by area effects spells.
Warlocks 
Warlock Epic Mount quest added. To begin, speak with a demon trainer in any of the capital cities: Kurgal, Martha Strain, Spackle Thornberry, or Jubahl Corpseeker.

Random world items that had increased healing effects were mislabeled, and the amount of increased healing appeared to be half of what was actually occurring. The amount shown on the item is now an accurate representation of the healing increase.
The Celestial Orb and Robe of the Archmage will no longer trigger the cooldowns of a Mage's mana gems. Mana gems are now on their own unique cooldown category.
Tiny Black Whelping item changed to Dark Whelpling to reflect the name of the creature summoned.
Fixed a typo in the aura description for the Mighty Rage potion.
+Spell damage and +Healing effects have been increased in effectiveness to make them more attractive to players.

Pimgib's Collar is now unique.
Frayed Abomination Stitchings are now considered to be uncommon items.

Ghostweave Belt pattern is no longer bind on acquire.
Randal Worth in Stormwind now only teaches apprentice level leatherworking.

Requirements to make the Helm of Fire were reduced.
Raids & Dungeons 
Azuregos now has a new ability - Mark of Frost. A player who is hit with the Mark of Frost will be temporarily frozen in a block of ice should they attempt to re-engage Azuregos. Mark of Frost is extremely powerful and will persist through death and resurrection.
Bael'Gar, Lord Incendius, and Golem Lord Argelmach are now slightly lower level than previously. This will provide a much better progression of creature and boss levels in Blackrock Depths.
The Baroness Anastari encounter has been changed. Players who become unpossessed will now have full health, and after the Baroness unpossesses a player there will be a much longer cooldown before she can cast possess again. These changes should make her a more balanced encounter for a 5 man group.
Lava Surgers no longer respawn once you kill Garr.
When Majordomo Executus submits, a chest is spawned next to him. This chest should only spawn the FIRST time he is defeated in a saved instance. If a guild tries him a second or third night, no chest should spawn.

Onyxia will once again drop two upper tier class set helms.
Most of the non-class set items that dropped from Molten Core and Onyxia have had their effective levels increased, resulting in higher DPS weapons, and/or better stats and effects.
Players who defeat the Majordomo Executus encounter will now be rewarded with new epic items. This reward will only be granted the first time the encounter is defeated during the 6 day lifespan of a Molten Core instance.
The loot tables for some of the Molten Core bosses have been improved so they drop an additional epic item per kill.
World bosses such as Onyxia, Azuregos, and Lord Kazzak will no longer drop random blue items of a level lower than 50.
Prior to this patch, Molten Core boss creatures could drop items from one of two different tiered sets for every character class. The loot tables have been changed so Molten Core bosses will now only drop items from the lower tier class sets. However, some of the items from those sets were not previously dropping in Molten Core. These missing class set items will now drop in Molten Core, allowing players to complete their lower tier class sets. The higher tier class set pieces that once dropped in Molten Core will be found once again in Blackwing Lair, the next raiding zone scheduled for release in a future patch.
Future patches will include even more item rewards for these raid encounters, as well as improvements to the statistics, effects, and set bonuses for both tiers of the raid armor sets.
