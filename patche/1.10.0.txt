High-Level Instance Changes 
Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.

Quest Experience for Gold at Level 60 
Previously, quest experience was wasted if one completed a quest at level 60. In this patch, any quests done at maximum level will have their experience reward converted to a healthy amount of gold, thus adding additional incentive to completing those quests in your log once you hit 60.

New Final Destination Flight Paths! 
If you're making several jumps to get to your destination, you will now be able to choose that flight path from your initial Flight Master. The costs will remain the same, but you no longer need to manually click on each path. The UI has also been improved significantly.

Players in Alterac Valley will no longer drop Darkspear Troll Mojo, Dwarf Spines, Forsaken Hearts, Human Bone Chips, Orc Teeth, etc. and the quests have been removed for these items.

A new level 52 druid quest that takes place in Un'Goro crater has been added.
Hunters 
Multi-Shot - This ability now has its attack power normalized the same as melee instant attacks. This means that the attack power contribution from all ranged weapons will be the same, no matter what their speed. All weapons will contribute attack power as if they were 2.8 speed. Weapons slower than 2.8 speed will do slightly less damage than previously; weapons faster than 2.8 speed will do slightly more damage.

Fixed problem where a tamed pet would be lost if the hunter died as the tame completed.

Arcane Brilliance - Range and area of effect increased.
Impact - When a fire spell is reflected back at the caster, the caster will now correctly receive the Impact effect.

Eye for an Eye - This talent can now trigger while you are mounted.

All racial priest spell replacements have had their training costs reduced.
Prayer of Fortitude - Range and area of effect increased.
Holy Fire - Is now available to all priests, starting at level 20.
Mind Soothe - Is now instant cast.
Shadowform - Now reduces all physical damage taken (melee and ranged), as the tooltip suggests.

The healing debuff does not stack with the warrior's Mortal Strike ability, although the damage penalty now stacks with either Touch of Weakness or Curse of Weakness.

Lesser Heal - Mana cost dropped approximately 9%.
Heal - Ranks 2, 3, and 4, cast time reduced to 3 seconds. Rank 1 mana cost dropped approximately 9%. Rank 2, 3, and 4 the healing amount has been reduced to generate the same amount of healing per cast time as before the cast time was reduced. Rank 2, 3, and 4, the mana cost was reduced to cost approximately 9% less mana per point of healing generated. The net effect on all ranks is that the healing per mana is 10% higher, the cast time is limited to 3 seconds, and the healing per second is unchanged. Note that spells with less than 3.5 second cast time will not receive the full bonus from plus healing items.
Greater Heal - Cast time reduced to 3 seconds. Healing and Mana cost reduced so that the healing per second is unchanged, but the healing per mana is increased approximately 10%. Note that spells with less than 3.5 second cast time will not receive the full bonus from plus healing items.

Items 
Relics have been introduced to the game. These are class specific items for Druids, Paladins, and Shaman which can be equipped in the ranged slot. Currently there are a handful for each class which can be found scattered throughout Blackrock Depths, Blackrock Spire, Dire Maul, Scholomance, Stratholme, and The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. We hope that you enjoy the first round of available relics and we will continue to add more in future patches.
Many items in Blackrock Depths, Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Spire have been re-evaluated and adjusted to make them more appealing. In addition several new items have been added to all of these instances.
The following item sets have had their set bonuses adjusted: Valor, Magister's, Lightforge, Shadowcraft, Dreadmist, Devout, Wildheart, Beaststalker, and Elements.
The locations of some of the waist, wrist, and hand slot pieces of the dungeon armor sets have been moved from their old creatures, including the Lightforge Gauntlets and the Magister's Boots. Additional creature types can also drop many of the previously difficult to obtain armor pieces.
All of the hand slot items in the dungeon armor sets are now bind on equip. The Belt of Valor is also now bind on equip.
Death's Head Vestment and Wolfrunner Shoes now have stats more appropriate for cloth wearers.

The Lightning Shield bonus on the Ten Storms set will now work the same way as all other Lightning Shield auras, including increased damage from bonus spell damage effects.
The tooltip on Thunderfury has been clarified to indicate that only the primary target will receive the slowing effect. In addition, the two effects have been broken down into two different debuffs to prevent incorrect information from appearing in the debuff tooltip for secondary targets (previously secondary targets were told they were slowed when they were not actually slowed).
Wrath of Cenarius will now trigger off all damaging spells.
The charges from the Zandalarian Hero Charm will now be consumed by melee and ranged abilities and spells which do non-physical damage. This includes: Hammer of Wrath, Judgement of Righteousness, Seal of Command, Judgement of Command, Volley, and Arcane Shot. The trinket will also now burn charges from each casting of a damage over time spell, heal over time spell, and area aura spells such as Blizzard and Consecration. Only one charge will be burned per area spell cast, rather than multiple charges per target hit as was previously the case.
The Panther Hide Bag from High Priestess Arlokk will no longer take the place of other items. Instead, this item will now sometimes drop in addition to the normal loot.
The following items were found to be more powerful than intended and have been tuned to be more in line with their level: Satyr's Bow, Inventor's Focal Sword, and Scepter of the Unholy.
Green Whelp Armor no longer affects targets above level 50 and the sleep duration was reduced to 10 seconds.
Many Recipes now have different icons. Recipe icons should correspond with the item color; a green-glowing scroll is a green recipe, and a blue-glowing scroll is a blue recipe, for example. As a reminder, white recipes can be purchased from a vendor somewhere in the world, so players should not pay too much for them at the Auction House.
The Phantom Blade's effect will now prevent players from trying to become stealthed or invisible.
The Luffa and Talisman of Ephemeral Power now have sell prices.
The Crystal Force, Crystal Ward, and Oil of Immolation effects now have effect tooltips.

The Chromatic Boots and Boots of the Fallen Hero have had their stats adjusted.
The duration of the Fetish of the Sand Reaver's effect has been increased, but the effect lowered.
Many trinkets will now trigger a cooldown equal to the duration of their effects that will prevent simultaneous use of more than one of these trinkets. The Trinkets affected include the Zandalarian Hero Charm, Zandalarian Hero Badge, Zandalarian Hero Medallion, and most all the other Trinkets available from Zul'Gurub, Earthstrike, the Talisman of Ephemeral Power, and the level 50 class quest trinkets such as the Devilsaur Eye.

Players will no longer be stuck in zoomed vision if they zone while using the Ornate Spyglass.
