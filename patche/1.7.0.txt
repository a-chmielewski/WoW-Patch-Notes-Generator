Pet Abilities
Hunters now have the first round of pet customization available. New passive abilities include increased armor, stamina, Fire resistance, Frost resistance, Nature resistance, Shadow resistance, and Arcane resistance.
All Hunter pets have their abilities unlearned. Training points have been fully refunded. (Abilities the Hunter has learned to teach their pets have not been lost. For example, if you have the ability to teach your pets "Claw 3", you will still be able to do so in this patch. However, your pet will have to be taught this ability again by using the Beast Training interface.)
Hunter pets can now be untrained of all their skills from any beast trainer in the major cities. Similar to talents, untraining a specific pet scales up as you do it more times: 10 silver, 50 silver, 1 gold, 2 gold, 3 gold, etc., eventually stopping at 10 gold.
Training point costs for all abilities have been rebalanced. You'll now be able to use all your pet's training points with meaningful choices. To help make "hunting" pets more viable in more situations, the Growl ability is now free to all pets.
Hunter pets can now learn a maximum of four active abilities. Active abilities include Claw, Bite, Dash, Dive, Cower, Prowl, Screech, Scorpid Poison, Growl, and Furious Howl.
Bats, owls, and carrion birds can now learn the Screech ability, a fast single-target attack that also lowers the attack power of all enemies within melee range of the pet.
Cats can now learn Stealth. In addition to being unseen, they receive a damage bonus for their first attack coming out of stealth.
Scorpids can now learn Scorpid Poison. The poison deals Nature damage over time and stacks up to five times on a single enemy.
Wolves can now learn Furious Howl. The howl adds a flat amount of damage to all nearby party member's next attack (within 15 yards).
Hunter pets now gain experience based on the level difference between them and their target rather than the difference between the Hunters and their target. This will make it much easier to level up a low level pet. Keep in mind that the Hunter must still kill creatures from which he/she will gain experience.
The tooltips for quick Hunter shots have been updated to show them as instant abilities.
Feign Death is no longer resisted by players.
Hunters are now able to name their pets while mounted.
Hunter's pets will be smarter about when to use Dash/Dive.

Spell Lock (Felhunter) - In addition to interrupting spellcasting, it will now silence the target for a short duration.
Benefits received from the old Master Conjuror talent should now be removed on all Warlocks.
Firestone - When a Firestone is equipped, it should no longer interrupt tradeskill creation.
Demonic Sacrifice - All effects gained from sacrificing the pet should no longer be dispellable.
Conflagrate - The Conflagrate spell is now instant cast. The damage and mana cost has been raised on all ranks of the spell.

Succubus pets will be smarter about when to use Seduction.
Succubus pets can now autocast Lesser Invisibility.
Fixed a bug where Fear and Curse of Recklessness, when used together, would prevent targets from casting spells.
Fixed a bug where Soul Link and Power Word: Shield, when used together, would heal the Warlock instead of splitting or absorbing damage.
Demon Armor - The armor increase will now stack together with Scrolls of Protection.
The Improved Drain Mana talent no longer does additional damage from plus damage items. This bonus damage was unintended and was a bug.

Shield Slam - Threat caused increased.
Shoot Bow/Gun/Crossbow - Should no longer cause a global cooldown on all other abilities.
Sweeping Strikes will now ignore dead targets, and will ignore PvP enabled targets if you are not PvP enabled
Items 
We have determined that the defense statistic was being applied to items too liberally, causing those items to be stronger than they should have been relative to other items of the same level with different effects.

User Interface 
New "Dressing Room" Interface now available! If you control-left click on any item, item reference (vendors, quests) or item link (chat), a UI panel will appear showing your character wearing that item. You can then use the same command (control-left click) on additional items to add to the preview appearance. In addition, the Auction House now has a checkbox in the upper right-hand corner; if checked, any item you click on within the Auction House will automatically be previewed on your character.
Need Before Greed and Group Loot options have been improved. The rolling window that appears when an item of the threshold and above is looted now has three buttons: a Need button (the dice), a Greed button (the coin), and a close button. Any players who select Need will get a chance to roll first for the item, with the high roller winning. If no one selects Need, all characters who selected Greed will then roll, with the highest roll winning the item. If everyone closes the window, the item becomes lootable by anyone in the group.

A confirmation dialog is now shown when you choose to make an Inn your home.
The tooltip for spells like Seal of the Crusader correctly reflects the benefit of the spell, instead of occasionally being off by one.

Pet spells in macros are now supported, both using /cast and using CastSpellByName().
If you omit the rank of a spell in /cast or CastSpellByName(), it will use the highest rank of the spell which you know.
While it will still be possible to override files in Interface/FrameXML, doing so is discouraged (and is likely to become impossible in a future release). Significant API additions are being made to eliminate the need for such direct FrameXML changes.
You will now be able to list .lua files directly in the addon .toc file.
The SetPoint() and SetAllPoints() script functions can take an actual frame instead of a frame name.
TargetNearest* script functions will only work in response to a button click or a key binding, to discourage addons which scan the battlefield for targets.
Addon-specific Saved Variables!
Each addon's saved variables will be saved in the file WTF\Account\{accountname}\SavedVariables\{addonname}.lua, and will only be loaded when the addon is loaded.
IMPORTANT: The first time you enter the game with this change, you must make sure all your addons are enabled, or their saved variables will be lost! If you accidentally do this once, you can recover by quitting the game, moving your backup SavedVariables.lua into place and restarting the game with addons enabled.

Addon Loading On Demand!
If you add the following line to your addon's .toc file, it will not be loaded at the normal load time, it will instead be dynamically loaded upon request:
LoadOnDemand: 1
You can query to see if an addon is loaded by using the new IsAddOnLoaded("addonname") function, and you can load an addon dynamically using the LoadAddOn("addonname") function. This function returns true if the addon is loaded successfully, and can be safely and efficiently called even if the addon is already loaded. For your convenience, the function UIParentLoadAddOn("addonname") is provided which will attempt to load the addon and pop up an error message if it failed to load for any reason. Once an addon is loaded, the ADDON_LOADED event is sent, with arg1 set to the name of the addon. An addon can listen for that event, and when it receives that event with its own name, it can safely access its saved variables. An important thing to note is that when an addon is loaded dynamically, it doesn't have access to any of the virtual frame templates that are defined by FrameXML, including font definitions.

millis = debugprofilestop() - return the time in milliseconds since the last call to debugprofilestart()

Addon Saved Variables
SavedVariables will no longer drop stored numbers to single precision.
Infinite/Nan values no longer cause corrupted SavedVariables.lua file. (Written as nils with comment)
Chat and Combat Logging
The script functions ChatFrameLog() and ToggleCombatLogFileWrite() are obsolete.
Added script function: isLogging=LoggingChat([newState]) (Returns new state (or current state if no argument))
Added script function: isLogging=LoggingCombat([newState]) (Returns new state (or current state if no argument))
New slash command /chatlog toggles chat logging (/combatlog toggles combat logging)
The file for the chat log is Logs\WoWChatLog.txt and the file for the combat log is Logs\WoWCombatLog.txt
Chat and combat log files will be appended to rather than overwritten.
You now receive combat log messages and damage feedback when you are being attacked by creatures you can't see.
